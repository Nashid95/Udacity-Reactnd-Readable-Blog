-How to use blog:
  In the home page you will be able to view the preloaded 2 posts from the server. you can click on new post and it will take you to a new page where you can type in a new post and add it and it will redirect you to the home page with the new post there. on the home page you can give a post like or dislike to change the popularity of the post, you can also delete the post or edit the content and the title of the post. if you want to see more of the post you can click on the title of the post where you can view the full post with all of the comments that are on it. on the post's specific page you can do all u did on the home page. but you can do more like commenting on the post or giving like or dislike to comment, delete a comment or even just edit the comment.
